===========================
Built sing a Seam-Carving Algorithm

By David Gonzalez <davidgmz@umich.edu>

## Longer Description
- Developed a content-aware image resizing program using a seam-carving algorithm to preserve key visual content during image resizing
- The algorithm works by calculating pixel energy through intensity differences of surrounding pixels for efficient resizing of images
